# Asset Validation
I created a small script that checks if the widget blueprints respect a specific naming convention, in this case, the widgets must start with "WBP_". If they violate the rule, an error is thrown when the asset is saved.

# Custom Project Settings 
Using the DeveloperSettings I created my section in Unreal's Project Settings (UI Settings). This section should enable fast iteration over the whole UI in a game, such as replacing assets, updating timer values, creating colour charts and so on. The usage of a config file is endless. In my little experiment, I added a section for Button Icons, for Xbox and PlayStation buttons. (This is for demonstration purposes only -Â if the project uses Common UI, this would be redundant)

# Widget Safe Zone Component
I was curious about the safe zone component from UMg and how it reacts to different platforms, specifically mobile. I found out how to test with it using the unreal console.

# Automation & Testing part 1
I briefly touched the surface of unit testing and automation. It's a comprehensive topic I will explore more in the future, but because this project is just a little experiment, I didn't go too in-depth with it. I refreshed my memory on how to access the Session Frontend, the type of tests and how to run the tests.
