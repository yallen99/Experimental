# Asset Validation
I created a small script that checks if the widget blueprints respect a specific naming convention, in this case, the widgets must start with "WBP_". If they violate the rule, an error is thrown when the asset is saved.

# Custom Project Settings 
Using the DeveloperSettings I created my own section in Unreal's Project Settings (UI Settings). This section should enable fast iteration over the whole UI in a game, such as replacing assets, updating timer values, creating colour charts and so on. The usages of a config file are endless. In my little experiment, I added a section for Button Icons, for Xbox and PlayStation buttons. (This is for demonstration purposes only -Â if the project uses Common UI, this would be redundant)
